WebComponent that extends the HTMLElement class, allowing developers to create custom HTML elements. The component accepts three properties:

styles: A string representing CSS styles for the component.
template: A function returning HTML content for the component.
state: An object representing the internal state of the component.
In the constructor, it initializes the component's state, attaches a shadow DOM to encapsulate the component's styles and structure, and sets up an event listener for a custom event named 'render'.

The render() method constructs the component's content by combining styles and template HTML, then updates the shadow DOM with the new content and dispatches a custom event named 'render'.

The connectedCallback() method is called when the component is inserted into the DOM, triggering the rendering process.

The afterRender() method is currently empty but could be used for any post-rendering operations or additional functionalities.

Overall, this component provides a structure for creating encapsulated, customizable HTML elements with their own CSS and HTML content.
